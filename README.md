# Project-E_Waste_Generation_Classification
As part of my internship project, this repository contains work on classifying images of electronic waste (e-waste) using EfficientNetV2B0, a pre-trained deep learning model. The goal is to identify and sort e-waste types such as batteries, screens and mobile devices.

Technologies & Libraries Used:

- TensorFlow & Keras : For model creation and training.
- EfficientNetV2B0 : Pre-trained model used via transfer learning.
- Matplotlib & Seaborn : For visualization.
- Scikit-learn : For evaluation metrics.
- Gradio : For building a simple user interface.

Current Progress: 

- [x] Notebook created and saved to GitHub.
- [x] Core libraries imported.
- [ ] Dataset upload and organization.
- [ ] Model training and testing.
- [ ] Evaluation and visualizations.

Learning Goals:

As part of the Shell-Edunet Skills4Future AICTE Internship, this project is aimed at helping me:
-Gain practical experience in solving real-world problems using AI tools and techniques.
-Understand the fundamentals of model building, evaluation and optimization.
-Learn how to handle image data through importing, preprocessing, and visualization.
-Develop skills in presenting and communicating project outcomes to industry experts.

Acknowledgements:

I would like to thank Edunet Foundation, AICTE and Shell for giving me the opportunity to participate in the ongoing Skills4Future Internship program. I am also thankful to the mentors and coordinators for their guidance and support in helping me get started with the project. As I progress through the upcoming weeks, I look forward to learning more, gaining practical exposure and developing my skills further with the help of this structured and supportive program.
