# Project-E_Waste_Generation_Classification
As part of my internship project, this repository contains work on classifying images of electronic waste (e-waste) using EfficientNetV2B0, a pre-trained deep learning model. The goal is to identify and sort e-waste types such as batteries, screens and mobile devices.

Technologies & Libraries Used:

- TensorFlow & Keras : For model creation and training.
- EfficientNetV2B0 : Pre-trained model used via transfer learning.
- Matplotlib & Seaborn : For visualization.
- Scikit-learn : For evaluation metrics.
- Gradio : For building a simple user interface.

Week 1 Progress: 

- [x] Notebook created and saved to GitHub.
- [x] Core libraries imported.
- [ ] Dataset upload and organization.
- [ ] Model training and testing.
- [ ] Evaluation and visualizations.

Current Progress:

Learning Goals:

As part of the Shell-Edunet Skills4Future AICTE Internship, this project is aimed at helping me:
-Gain practical experience in solving real-world problems using AI tools and techniques.
-Understand the fundamentals of model building, evaluation and optimization.
-Learn how to handle image data through importing, preprocessing, and visualization.
-Develop skills in presenting and communicating project outcomes to industry experts.

Week 2 Progress:

In the second week of the project the focus was on executing the next phase of the code provided in the source notebook. This involved organizing the dataset, applying transfer learning using EfficientNetV2B0 and training the classification model. Model performance was evaluated using accuracy and loss metrics and the results were visualized through plots. A confusion matrix was also generated to analyze class-wise prediction accuracy.

This part of the project helped enhance my understanding of model training workflows and deepened my exposure to evaluation techniques.

Acknowledgements:

I would like to thank Edunet Foundation, AICTE and Shell for giving me the opportunity to participate in the ongoing Skills4Future Internship program. I am also thankful to the mentors and coordinators for their guidance and support in helping me get started with the project. As I progress through the upcoming weeks, I look forward to learning more, gaining practical exposure and developing my skills further with the help of this structured and supportive program.
