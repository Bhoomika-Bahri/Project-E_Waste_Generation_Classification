**Learning Goals:**

As part of the Shell-Edunet Skills4Future AICTE Internship, this project is aimed at helping me:
-Gain practical experience in solving real-world problems using AI tools and techniques.
-Understand the fundamentals of model building, evaluation and optimization.
-Learn how to handle image data through importing, preprocessing, and visualization.
-Develop skills in presenting and communicating project outcomes to industry experts.

**Sustainability Focus:**

A core objective of this internship was to understand how AI can support environmental sustainability especially through real-world applications like E-Waste Classification. This project showed me how automating the sorting of electronic waste can reduce human effort, increase recycling accuracy and support safer, more responsible disposal of electronic components.

Beyond the project itself, a dedicated session on system design and sustainable thinking helped me see how AI solutions can be built to use fewer resources, adapt to changing conditions and create long-term impact. I learned that sustainability in AI isn’t just about what the model does but how responsibly and thoughtfully it's designed.

This experience helped me connect my technical learning with a larger environmental purpose and gave me a clearer sense of how AI can be a tool for both innovation and positive change.

**Week 2 Summary:**

In the second week of the project the focus was on executing the next phase of the code provided in the source notebook. This involved organizing the dataset, applying transfer learning using EfficientNetV2B0 and training the classification model. Model performance was evaluated using accuracy and loss metrics and the results were visualized through plots. A confusion matrix was also generated to analyze class-wise prediction accuracy.

This part of the project helped enhance my understanding of model training workflows and deepened my exposure to evaluation techniques.

**Week 3 Summary:**

In the final week of the internship, I had the opportunity to bring together everything I had learned over the past few weeks and complete the full execution of the project. I revisited each stage of the AI workflow—from data loading and preprocessing to model training and evaluation—gaining a clearer understanding of how these steps work together in a complete machine learning pipeline.

By implementing transfer learning using the EfficientNetV2B0 model, I learned how pre-trained models can be applied effectively to new tasks, saving time while still producing strong results. Working with image data taught me the importance of preparing the dataset properly through resizing and augmentation which had a noticeable effect on the model’s performance. I also deepened my understanding of evaluation methods like accuracy, loss and confusion matrix and how to interpret them to analyze the success of a classification model.

Through the sessions held during the internship, I was introduced to several convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures. Although I did not implement these other models in the project, learning about their structures and use cases helped me understand how the choice of architecture can influence model performance depending on the problem and data.

This week also helped me see the importance of organizing the code clearly and making the results easy to follow. I realized how valuable it is to present a project in a way that is both technically sound and easy for others to understand, especially when working in collaborative or professional environments.

Completing the final notebook allowed me to apply everything I had learned and build confidence in handling real-world AI tasks.
