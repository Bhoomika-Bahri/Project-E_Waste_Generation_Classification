# Project-E_Waste_Generation_Classification
As part of my internship project, this repository contains work on classifying images of electronic waste (e-waste) using EfficientNetV2B0, a pre-trained deep learning model. The goal is to identify and sort e-waste types such as batteries, screens and mobile devices.
